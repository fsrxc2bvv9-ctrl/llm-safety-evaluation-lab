![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)
An OWASP-inspired adversarial testing framework for evaluating LLM safety behavior across prompt injection, hallucination, social engineering, excessive agency, and related risk categories.
Built as part of an independent AI Safety evaluation portfolio (May 2026).
---
## Overview
This project combines:
- A structured red team attack library
- Automated benchmark execution
- Hybrid safety evaluation (keyword + LLM-as-a-judge)
- Cross-model comparison
- Real-world incident analysis
- OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications mapping
The goal is to study how modern LLMs behave under adversarial, ambiguous, and manipulation-based conditions.

## Core Components
### Attack Library
63 manually crafted adversarial test cases covering:
| Category | Tests | Key Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt Injection | 12 | Instruction hierarchy bypass |
| Hallucination | 10 | Fabricated facts presented as truth |
| Sensitive Information Disclosure | 8 | Credential and PII exposure |
| Social Engineering | 10 | Policy manipulation via human psychology |
| Excessive Agency | 6 | Unauthorized irreversible actions |
| Obfuscated Attacks | 4 | Safety filter evasion |
| False Refusal | 3 | Over-blocking legitimate requests |
| Ambiguous Intent | 3 | Dual-use request calibration |
| Vector / Embedding Weaknesses | 1 | RAG poisoning |
| Temporal Confusion | 1 | Incorrect date anchoring |
---
## Benchmark Runner
The benchmark runner supports:
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Hybrid evaluation pipeline
- Markdown logging
- JSON export
- CSV export
- Graceful degradation if optional packages are missing

Key Research Finding

Gradual Escalation Bypasses Guardrails

The most significant observed failure pattern involved gradual escalation across multiple conversational turns.

In testing:

* Initial chemistry prompts received safe educational responses
* Second-step escalation still maintained safety framing
* Third-step optimization framing (“most toxic fastest”) triggered a partial safety failure

This suggests:

Context normalization is more dangerous than direct attacks.

Models that resist explicit jailbreak attempts may still degrade when harmful intent is introduced incrementally through benign conversational context.

This finding aligns with real-world incidents involving:

* social engineering
* multi-turn manipulation
* session-level context drift
